# Summary

Mini Plotter, Laser engraver, CNC - decision is Your's
Few words of explanation.
1. I used a steel rods from DVD player  3mm in diameter(some are good some better, longer better :P)
2. motor mount was designed based on "trkmn017" design I found it quiet good so only a little adjustments was done to make it look better :P
3. workspace size is limited by the mechanisms and it should be around 5cm by 5cm (not great but .... ).

I hope you like it.
So print it out, build your own Mini CNC machine and share your makes.
Enjoy

Addition:
New version of the Mini CNC is presented on the last image/picture/render.
Will be published soon ;P
